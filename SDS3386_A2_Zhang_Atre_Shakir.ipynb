    "This is a **group** assignment. You must complete it with **two** other people (except by prior permission), preferably those you have chosen to work on a project with (though this is not required). By the time you submit your assignment, all group members should understand all answers and be able to explain them. I may ask a few people about them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Start here: Download this file to your laptop, rename or make a copy of it with filename in the format: SDS3386_A2_Name1_Name2_Name3.ipynb, where \"Name1\" etc. is the last name of a group member. Complete the assignment by editing the file. Edit this first cell of the notebook and replace the second line \"2023 Fall, Tanya Schmah\" with a list of the full names of all group members. If group members work on different copies of the notebook, then when you're finished you must combine your notebooks into one \"clean\" copy for submission. When finished, export as HTML, and upload both the jupyter notebook and the HTML file to Brightspace. Each student should submit a copy of the same assignment to Brightspace, with a comment (added in the box on the assignment submission page) that lists the names of your group members.\n",

    "You may copy and modify code from your Lab exercises, but if you copy more than two lines from another source, note the source in a comment."
